"The Wolfram Language is an infinite evaluation system. When you enter an expression, the Wolfram Language will keep on using definitions it knows until it gets a result to which no definitions apply."

"In the standard evaluation procedure, the Wolfram System first evaluates the head of an expression and then evaluates each element of the expression. These elements are in general themselves expressions, to which the same evaluation procedure is recursively applied."
